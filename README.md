Wraith is a screenshot comparison tool, created by developers at BBC News.

This fork publishes a Docker image named 'superwese/wraith-chrome' to the docker registry.
Neither casperjs nor phantomjs is installed.


The enclosed wraith version is patched:
-There is an additional `setup_folders() when running `wraith latest` to ensure the directory structure exists when screenshots are taken.
-`---no-sandbox` is added to the `chrome.options` so chrome runs in the container.
